## Featured Projects

### Autonomous Agentic Risk Intelligence System

**Challenge:** Social media monitoring requires analyzing thousands of unstructured tweets - manual analysis is slow, inconsistent, and doesn't scale.

**Solution:** Built a multi-agent AI system using CrewAI orchestration: Hunter agent detects anomalies (high recall), Critic agent validates with severity scoring (1-10), Sorter agent dynamically prioritizes findings across the full dataset.

**Impact:** Analyzed 5,000 tweets in ~20 minutes - achieving 90% time reduction vs. manual deep analysis. Produced prioritized risk reports with self-correction loops for data integrity.

**Tech Stack:** CrewAI, Groq Llama-3.3-70B, Python 3.12, pandas, agentic workflows
